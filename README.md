# [Procify](http://procify.herokuapp.com)

Procify is a web application that allows users to listen to existing songs and create playlists. It is built with Ruby on Rails as the backend, PostgreSQL as the database system, and React/Redux as the frontend.

## Creating Playlists

Users can create a new playlist, delete their playlist, add/remove songs to a playlist.

## Continuous Song Play

A song can be listened to while browsing the website. This song can be played or paused.
